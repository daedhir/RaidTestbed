This project is an experimental World of Warcraft addon to test out techniques.

I'm planning to use a lot of this stuff to make an addon that
will extend the new Cataclym raid frames to allow for user-defined
buffs and debuffs to be shown with emphasis on the raid frames, 
similar to what can be done with Grid.
